# Setting up Human-in-the-loop (HiTL) Bayesian Optimization workflows

## GitHub Issues

Core tasks and sub-projects will be tracked using the [AC Training Lab GitHub issues](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). See for example [setting up the OT-2 liquid handler](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/issues/26) and [RS232 control of digital scale](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/issues/20). Many of these will also be surfaced to [the corresponding GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/AccelerationConsortium/projects/3?query=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen) (private) and any applicable [training lab milestones](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/milestone/1).

## Pull Requests

When you start writing some code, create a new branch and open a draft pull request (PR) pointing to the training lab repo `main` branch. AC Training staff will have write access to anything other than the `main` branch, so if this applies to you, you can simply clone the repo and create a new branch. You're welcome to fork the repo if that's more straightforward for you. These PRs make it easier to have tight feedback cycles. See for example [mycobot 280 implementation](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/pull/52).
