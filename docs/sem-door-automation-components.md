## 3. Jam Nut (M4, Stainless Steel)
**Product:** Stainless Steel Hex Jam Nut, M4 × 0.7 mm Thread  
**Link:** [McMaster-Carr 91828A110](https://www.mcmaster.com/91828A110)  
**Justification:** Secures the rod end to the tie rod, preventing loosening during repeated actuation. Stainless steel for durability and corrosion resistance.

## 4. Handle Attachment (Cable Tie or U-Bolt Clamp)
**Product:** Select based on SEM handle geometry. Recommended: Stainless steel cable tie or U-bolt clamp sized to fit handle diameter.  
**Link:** [Cable Ties](https://www.mcmaster.com/cable-ties/) | [U-Bolt Clamps](https://www.mcmaster.com/u-bolts/)  
**Justification:** Provides a secure, non-slip connection to the SEM handle. Stainless steel options preferred for longevity and chemical resistance.

### Cable Tie for SEM Handle Attachment

**Selected Product:** [McMaster-Carr Stainless Steel Cable Tie, 5" Length, 0.18" Width, Part Number 6898K381](https://www.mcmaster.com/6898K381/)

**Specs:** Fits bundle diameters up to 1" (compatible with 20–24 mm SEM handle), 0.18" width, 5" length, 316 stainless steel for maximum corrosion resistance.

**Engineering Justification:** This cable tie is highly corrosion-resistant, fits the 20–24 mm handle diameter, and provides secure, low-profile clamping for the SEM handle geometry. The 0.18" width and 5" length ensure mechanical strength and ease of installation, while the 316 stainless steel construction prevents degradation in laboratory environments and ensures long-term reliability.

### Engineering Notes

- All components are stainless steel for maximum corrosion resistance in laboratory environments.
- 10-32 imperial thread is a standard for light mechanical linkages, ensuring compatibility and ease of sourcing.
- Ball joint rod ends and linkages allow for angular misalignment and smooth operation of the SEM door.
- Thin-profile jam nuts are used to lock rod ends in place without adding bulk.
- Cable tie/U-bolt clamp secures the linkage to the actuator or door bracket.

### Assembly Guidance

1. Cut the threaded rod to the required length for your SEM door linkage.
2. Thread ball joint rod ends onto each end of the rod; use jam nuts to lock them in place.
3. Use the ball joint linkage for additional articulation if needed.
4. Secure the completed linkage to the actuator and door bracket using the stainless steel cable tie/U-bolt clamp.
5. Verify smooth operation and adjust as needed.
