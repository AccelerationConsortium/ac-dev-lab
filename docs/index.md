# üè¢ AC Training Lab

```{warning}
This is an ongoing project. If you would like to participate or are interested in contributing, please [introduce yourself](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/discussions/2) or reach out to sterling.baird@utoronto.ca.
```

The [Acceleration Consortium](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium) (AC)
Training Lab is a remotely accessible facility that houses a
diverse set of physical hardware for self-driving laboratories (SDLs) including
liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile robotic arms,
and synthesis and characterization modules. Where possible, both educational and
research-grade hardware are included. The AC Training Lab is used to
develop and test SDLs and to provide a platform for training students and
researchers in the use of SDLs. The [AC Training Lab GitHub repository](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab) also acts as an example of
setting up an autonomous laboratory.

The equipment in the training lab can be broadly categorized in the following
categories: characterization, prototyping, synthesis, dispensing, environment,
and infrastructure. See the image below for an example of some of the equipment
intended for the AC Training Lab.

## Workflows

The AC Training Lab is intended as a hands-on sandbox and prototyping environment for researchers. While the equipment is not restricted to particular workflows, we are actively developing a subset of readily accessible workflows for the AC Training Lab. Note that single workflow could be carried out using different sets of equipment within the training lab. These workflows will use dedicated hardware in a permanent setup to allow for 24/7 access. The core workflows that are planned, in development, or available are listed below:

| Name | Diagram | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
Light-based color matching | <img src="./_static/images/clslab-light.png" height=50> | Adjust red, green, and blue LED power levels to match a target color | Ready |
Liquid-based color matching | <img src="./_static/images/clslab-liquid.png" height=50> | Adjust diluted red, yellow, and blue food coloring pumping power to match a target color | Ready |
Solid-based color matching | <img src="./_static/images/clslab-solid.png" height=50> | Adjust the composition of red, yellow, and blue powder (e.g., wax) and processing conditions to match a target color | Development |
Chocolate tensile testing | | Adjust the composition and processing conditions of 3D printed chocolate tensile specimens to tune the microstructure for maximization of tensile strength | Development |
[Yeast growth](https://docs.pioreactor.com/experiments/yeast-growth-by-temperature) | | Adjust reactor temperature to maximize yeast growth and explore nonlinear effects | Development |
Titration | | Add a base of known concentration to an acid to find the equivalence point as determined by successive pH measurements | Development |
Conductivity | | Adjust the ratio of battery electrolyte reagants to maximize conductivity and redox potential for a target pH | Planning |
Polymer cross-linkage | | | Planning |


Supported workflows (i.e., non-permanent setups) that are planned, in development, or available are listed below:

| Name | Diagram | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alkaline Catalysis Lifecycle Testing | | Adjust the stress-cycling conditions of a nickel electrode in a KOH solution to investigate the cause of catalyst degredation | Development |


## Functionality

This refers to the infrastructure-focused capabilities showcased in the AC Training Lab. The core functionalities (intended as permanent demos) that are planned, development, or available are listed below. These functionalities may either be standalone or part of the workflows listed above.

| Name | Diagram | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vial transfer (stationary) | | Move a vial between adjacent modules | Ready |
| Vial transfer (mobile) | | Move a sample to a different location | Development |
| Vial capping/decapping | | Cap or decap a vial | Development |
| Tool changing | | Swap a tool on a robotic arm | Development |

## Feedback

We would love to get suggestions on the [types of workflows and functions](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/discussions/3) you'd like to see in the AC Training Lab!
