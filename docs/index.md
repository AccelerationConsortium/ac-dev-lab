# AC Training Lab

```{warning}
This is an ongoing project. If you would like to participate or are interested in contributing, please [introduce yourself](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/discussions/2) or reach out to sterling.baird@utoronto.ca.

The [Acceleration Consortium](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium) (AC)
Training Lab is meant to be a remotely accessible facility that will house a
diverse set of physical hardware for self-driving laboratories (SDLs) including
liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile robotic arms,
and synthesis and characterization modules. Where possible, both educational and
research-grade hardware will be included. The AC Training Lab will be used to
develop and test SDLs, and to provide a platform for training students and
researchers in the use of SDLs. This repository also acts as an example of
setting up an autonomous laboratory.

The equipment in the training lab can be broadly categorized in the following
categories: characterization, prototyping, synthesis, dispensing, environment,
and infrastructure. See the image below for an example of some of the equipment
intended for the AC Training Lab.
