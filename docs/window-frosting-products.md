## Installation Considerations

### Film Type Selection
- **Static Cling:** Removable, reusable, no adhesive residue. Best for temporary installations or rented spaces. May not adhere well to textured glass.
- **Adhesive-Backed:** More permanent, better adhesion, cleaner appearance. Difficult to remove and may leave residue.

### Coverage Strategy
For windows exceeding single roll dimensions:
1. **Horizontal Seaming:** Use multiple sheets vertically for tall windows (245 cm requires 2 sheets of standard 200 cm film)
2. **Vertical Seaming:** Use multiple sheets side-by-side for wide windows (99 cm width may require 2-3 narrower rolls)
3. **Overlap Method:** Slight overlap (1-2 cm) at seams creates continuous privacy coverage

### Installation Tools Required
- Spray bottle with soapy water solution
- Squeegee (often included with consumer products)
- Utility knife or razor blade
- Ruler or straight edge
- Lint-free cloth

### Laboratory-Specific Considerations
- **Full Privacy vs. Light Transmission:** All frosted films allow natural light while obscuring visibility
- **Chemical Resistance:** 3M Fasara and professional films offer better resistance to cleaning agents
- **UV Protection:** Most quality films include UV blocking (95-99%)
- **Durability:** Professional films last 10+ years, consumer films 3-5 years

## Recommended Purchase Plan

### Budget Option (Consumer-Grade)
**Total Cost:** ~$150-250 for all windows

- Amazon Extra-Wide Film (45.2" × 78.74"): 10-15 rolls
- Cover all windows with 1-2 sheets per window depending on dimensions
- DIY installation with included tools

### Mid-Range Option (Home Depot)
**Total Cost:** ~$300-400 for all windows

- Gila 4ft × 6.5ft rolls: 12-15 rolls

## Alternative: Curtains

As noted in the issue comments, hanging curtains may be a viable alternative or temporary solution:

### Blackout Curtains
- **Pros:** Complete privacy, easy installation, removable, no window modification
- **Cons:** Blocks all light when closed, requires curtain rods/tracks
- **Cost:** $20-50 per window panel

### Frosted/Sheer Curtains
- **Pros:** Privacy while allowing light, easy to remove/clean
- **Cons:** Less privacy than film, may not match laboratory aesthetic
- **Cost:** $15-40 per window panel
