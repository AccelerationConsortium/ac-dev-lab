### Verification Checklist

When evaluating alternatives, confirm:
- [ ] Thread pitch is M8 × 1.25 (not M8 × 1.0)
- [ ] 8-position pin configuration
- [ ] 1 male to 2 female configuration
- [ ] IP67 rating minimum
- [ ] Operating temperature range suitable for application
- [ ] Wire gauge compatibility (typically AWG 22-24)
- [ ] Locking mechanism (threaded or bayonet)

### Expected Price Range (Updated with Current Market Data)
Based on Perplexity search results, M8 8-position custom splitters typically range from **CAD $90-$250** depending on:
- Manufacturer (Phoenix Contact premium, generic options lower)
- IP rating and build quality (IP67+ for industrial applications)
- Cable length if pre-assembled
- Quantity discounts available
- Custom assembly vs. off-the-shelf junction boxes

### Recommended Solution Approach
Given the search results, the most practical approaches are:
1. **8-port M8 junction/distribution boxes** (readily available)
2. **Custom cable assembly** through major distributors (90-250 CAD)
3. **Modular connector solutions** using separate M8 components

### Alternative Approach (Updated)
Since exact 1M/2F 8-position splitters are confirmed unavailable off-the-shelf:
1. **Junction boxes**: Use 8-port M8 junction boxes with 1 input, 8 outputs (can use only 2)
2. **Custom assembly**: Contact suppliers for custom cable assembly services (confirmed available)
3. **Modular connectors**: Build using separate M8 connectors and distribution hardware
4. **Direct manufacturer contact**: Phoenix Contact, Turck, etc. for custom solutions
