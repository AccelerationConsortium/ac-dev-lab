### Manual Search Terms for Websites

When manually searching supplier websites, use these specific terms:
- "M8 connector splitter"
- "M8 Y-connector"
- "M8 T-connector"  
- "M8 distribution box"
- "M8 1M 2F splitter"
- "M8 8-position splitter"
- "M8 × 1.25 connector"

### Verification Checklist

When evaluating alternatives, confirm:
- [ ] Thread pitch is M8 × 1.25 (not M8 × 1.0)
- [ ] 8-position pin configuration
- [ ] 1 male to 2 female configuration
- [ ] IP67 rating minimum
- [ ] Operating temperature range suitable for application
- [ ] Wire gauge compatibility (typically AWG 22-24)
- [ ] Locking mechanism (threaded or bayonet)

### Expected Price Range
Industrial M8 splitters typically range from $25-75 CAD depending on:
- Manufacturer (Phoenix Contact premium, generic options lower)
- IP rating and build quality
- Cable length if pre-assembled
- Quantity discounts available

### Alternative Approach
If exact 1M/2F splitters are unavailable:
1. **Junction boxes**: Look for M8 junction boxes with 1 input, 2 outputs
2. **Custom assembly**: Some suppliers offer custom cable assembly services
3. **Modular connectors**: Build using separate M8 connectors and junction hardware

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Manual website searches** using the terms and suppliers listed above
2. **Direct phone contact** with Canadian distributors for personalized search assistance  
3. **Email inquiries** to manufacturer technical support with Robotiq part number for cross-reference
4. **Local industrial supply** visits for hands-on product evaluation

This systematic approach should successfully locate suitable M8 splitter alternatives despite the limitations of automated searching.
