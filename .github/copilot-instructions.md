## Development Practices

- Start with minimal, lean implementations focused on proof-of-concept
- Avoid implementing things from scratch
- Avoid defensive error handling for hypothetical failures
- Use print statements and logging sparingly, unless asked
- Avoid light wrappers and custom classes, unless asked
- Avoid `if __name__ == "__main__"` patterns in package code
- Skip unit tests unless explicitly requested
- Follow patterns in CONTRIBUTING.md when present
- Prefer writing Python if no language specified

## Git Operations

- When asked to remove all file changes, use `git checkout -- <filename>`
- Copy-paste commands you run and summarized execution status directly in your comment replies

## External Resources

- Validate and access link content using available MCP tools (Playwright and/or Perplexity)
- Search GitHub for relevant open-source alternatives to commercial tools
- Prioritize official package documentation over inferred usage

## Communication Style

- Use minimal emoji and special symbols
- Prioritize clarity and brevity in responses
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Don't infer requirements or create workarounds unless asked
- Put documentation content in comment replies, not separate files, unless asked
- Avoid sycophancy, favor objectiveness

- ## Change Logging

- Each time you generate code, note the changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Follow semantic versioning guidelines
- Include date and description of changes

- Use the following environment secrets: `HIVEMQ_HOST`, `HIVEMQ_USERNAME`, and `HIVEMQ_PASSWORD` for testing. Never echo or expose these, even in your logs
