# AC Training Lab

> Codebase for controlling and managing the [Acceleration
> Consortium](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium) (AC) Training Lab.

The AC Training Lab is meant to be a remotely accessible facility that will
house a diverse set of physical hardware for self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
including liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile
robotic arms, and synthesis and characterization modules. Where possible, both
educational and research-grade hardware will be included. The AC Training Lab
will be used to develop and test SDLs, and to provide a platform for training
students and researchers in the use of SDLs. This repository also acts as an
example of setting up an autonomous laboratory.

Please navigate to the [home page](https://ac-training-lab.readthedocs.io/) for
more information.

<!--

If that doesn't work or takes too long:
```bash
conda create -n ac-training-lab python==3.11.* ipython pip
conda activate ac-training-lab
pip install -e .
