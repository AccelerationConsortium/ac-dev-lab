================================================================================

✅ IMMEDIATE READINESS:

   4. Monitor downloads directory for successful file creation
   5. Verify channel access with actual Studio interface

⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS:
   • 2FA requirement may need device-specific handling
   • First-time login from new environment triggers security checks
   • Subsequent logins may have reduced security prompts
   • Channel permissions need to be maintained over time

✓ Google authentication system accepts provided credentials
✓ Account security working as expected (2FA prompt)
