Is there something like Prefect that uses decorator style easy syntax for communicating between distinct environments over the internet (prefect cloud) but has lighter weight dependencies and still has a cloud hosting option? (E.g., FastAPI or MQTT maybe?)

Thought for 28s
Short answer: yes. The closest “decorator-first, cloud-hosted, lighter than Prefect” options are Modal and Temporal. Also viable: Flyte (Union.ai), Dagster (Dagster+), Celery+hosted broker, Dask+Coiled, and Ray Serve+Anyscale.

Best fits

Modal — serverless Python with decorators (@app.function()), very small local deps; fully managed cloud. Good for RPC-like calls across environments.

Temporal — reliable distributed workflows with decorators (@workflow, activities). Managed Temporal Cloud; lightweight SDK on clients. Strong cross-env communication via task queues, signals, retries.

Also consider

Flyte (Union.ai) — Python decorators (@task, @workflow). Union.ai provides managed Flyte; OSS backend is heavier (Kubernetes) but the client code stays light.

Dagster (Dagster+) — decorators (@op, @job). Dagster+ is managed. Heavier than Modal/Temporal but good DX.

Celery — simple @app.task decorator; pair with hosted Redis/RabbitMQ (e.g., Redis Cloud, CloudAMQP). Light deps, but fewer orchestration features.

Dask + Coiled — @dask.delayed decorator; Coiled gives managed clusters; suited to parallel Python, less to workflow state.

Ray Serve + Anyscale — @serve.deployment decorator for microservices; Anyscale is the managed option. Heavier runtime than Modal.

Quick pick guide

Want the lightest “decorate and call in the cloud” experience → Modal. 
Modal

Need durable workflows with retries, signals, and cross-env task queues → Temporal Cloud. 
Temporal

Prefer OSS workflow semantics with managed control plane → Union.ai (Flyte) or Dagster+.

Need ultra-minimal deps and you can run a hosted broker → Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ.

If you want, I can sketch a 20-line example for Modal or Temporal matching your use case.

ChatGPT said:
I tried opening the PR link; got “Internal Error / 404 Not Found.”

Do you have a cached version, a diff, or a gist of that PR? Or another link (branch, patch file)? I can analyze once I see the changes.
