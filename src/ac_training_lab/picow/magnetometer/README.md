# Pico W Magnetometer

This device uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller with an MLX90393 magnetometer sensor to measure magnetic fields in three dimensions. The device connects to WiFi and can transmit sensor data through MQTT to enable remote monitoring. This can be useful for spatial referencing, similar to positioning blocks or AprilTags in a 3D space (e.g., by placing a magnetometer on a robot, a magnet on a device, and using the magnetometer to determine the position of the device relative to the robot).
