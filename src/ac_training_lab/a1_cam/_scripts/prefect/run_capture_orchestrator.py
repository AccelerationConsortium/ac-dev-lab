"""Async orchestrator that triggers a deployment and returns its result.

This uses `run_deployment` (async) to create and execute the flow run, then
reads the flow run via the Prefect client and calls `aresult()` on the final
state to retrieve the flow return value.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_capture_orchestrator.py [deployment-name]

Defaults to `capture-image/capture-image`.
