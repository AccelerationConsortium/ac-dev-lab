User: When I run the deployment via Prefect UI, it has a parameter "self"

```
To execute flow runs from this deployment, start a worker in a separate terminal that pulls workfrom the 'a1-cam-pool' work pool:

        $ prefect worker start --pool 'a1-cam-pool'

To schedule a run for this deployment, use the following command:

        $ prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'


You can also run your flow via the Prefect UI: https://app.prefect.cloud/account/5b838504-64cf-4297-9b35-b881ac6169b3/workspace/d2718b4c-b49a-43ce-83c2-baf6fb3b9665/deployments/deployment/f623f197-ced9-4b57-a69e-4bc7f82bce9f
```

GitHub Copilot: I'll read `device_prefect.py` to find where a bound method became a flow parameter.

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/bairdst4/Documents/GitHub/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py)

I'll patch device_prefect.py to make the Prefect flow a top-level function that instantiates `A1CamCapture`, so `self` is not exposed as a flow parameter.Now I'll apply a patch that replaces the instance flow with an instance helper and adds a top-level `@flow` wrapper.

Recording the work steps and marking them completed.

Done — I changed device_prefect.py so the Prefect flow is a top-level function (`capture_image`) that instantiates `A1CamCapture` and calls an instance helper (`_capture_image`), and updated the deployment entrypoint accordingly.

Next steps:
- Run the script to register the deployment:
```powershell
python src\ac_training_lab\a1_cam\device_prefect.py
```
- Confirm in the Prefect UI the deployment no longer shows a `self` parameter.
- To run the flow locally, start a worker and run the deployment:
```powershell
prefect worker start --pool 'a1-cam-pool'
prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'
```

Want me to run the registration command here and check the deployment output?

User: Sure

I'll read device_prefect.py to patch the misplaced top-level flow definition.

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/bairdst4/Documents/GitHub/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py)

I'll move the `@flow` definition to module level and leave the deployment call inside `if __name__ == '__main__'`. Then I'll run the script to register the deployment.

Success — the deployment registered without exposing `self`. The script output shows the `capture-image/capture-image` deployment was applied.

Next steps you can run:
- Start a worker to execute runs:
```powershell
prefect worker start --pool 'a1-cam-pool'
```
- Trigger the deployment:
```powershell
prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'
```

Anything else you want me to change or test?

Made changes.

User: Add a stop method to the dummy packages here. `close` too if that's not already there

GitHub Copilot: I'll add `stop` and `close` methods to both dummy `Picamera2` mock files. Proceeding to update the two files now.

Completed: *Add `stop` and `close` to dummy Picamera2 mocks* (4/4)

Done — added `stop()` and `close()` to both mock files:

- _picamera2.py
- _picamera2.py

Each now logs on `stop` and `close`, so `A1CamCapture.cleanup()` will work against the mocks. Need me to run a quick local test run of the flow or start a worker?

Made changes.

User: What are the latest terminal results?

GitHub Copilot: **Terminal Summary**

- **Deployment registration (`python src/.../device_prefect.py`)**: Successfully created/updated deployments — "Successfully created/updated all deployments!" and the `capture-image/capture-image` deployment was applied. Prefect suggested running:
  - `prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'`
  - UI link printed for the deployment.

- **Script run (same `python src/.../device_prefect.py`)**: Exit code `0` (deployment registration completed).

- **Prefect deployment run**: `prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'` — last recorded exit code `0` (no additional stdout/stderr captured here).

- **Prefect worker start**: `prefect worker start --pool 'a1-cam-pool'` — failed, exit code `1` (no detailed logs captured here).

- **Earlier error (now resolved)**: Deploy attempt initially failed with "Could not find work pool 'local'." — fixed by switching default work pool to `a1-cam-pool`.

Want me to re-run the worker start and capture its logs to diagnose the exit code `1`?

I think it's because I ran it initially on my local computer and then started the worker on the Pi, I guess there's a step I'm supposed to redo on the Pi?

GitHub Copilot: Created 5 todos

You're right — the error means the worker couldn't chdir to the local path recorded when you registered the deployment. Fix options (short):

- Quick fix (recommended): re-run the deployment registration on the Pi so the deployment's working directory matches the Pi's checkout.
  - SSH to the Pi, activate the env, cd into the repo, run:
    ```bash
    conda activate ac-dev-lab
    cd /path/to/ac-training-lab       # where the repo is on the Pi
    python src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py
    ```
  - Then start the worker on the Pi:
    ```bash
    prefect worker start --pool 'a1-cam-pool'
    prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'
    ```

- Alternative quick: clone the repo on the Pi at the exact same path used when you deployed (the path in the error), so chdir succeeds. Not ideal if OS/paths differ.

- More robust (recommended for future): change deployment to use pullable storage (git or Docker image) so workers always fetch code:
  - Git-based: build & apply a deployment that references your repository (see Prefect docs). Example flow build command:
    ```bash
    prefect deployment build src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py:capture_image \
      --name capture-image --apply --storage-type git \
      --storage-repo 'https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git'
    ```
  - Docker: build an image containing the code and use container infrastructure for the deployment.

Which would you like me to do next? I can (a) give exact git/docker deployment steps, (b) run the registration on the Pi for you (if you want me to run commands here), or (c) help you clone the repo to the Pi path.

```

GitHub Copilot: Flow finished successfully — worker submitted and the run completed (log shows libcamera startup and "Finished in state Completed()"). The flow's return value (the S3 URL) isn't printed to the Pi terminal by default.

Ways to view the returned string:
- Open the flow run page printed in the logs (the "View at https://app.prefect.cloud/.../runs/flow-run/<FLOW_RUN_ID>") and inspect the run details / Outputs section.
- Add an explicit log/print in the flow so the URL appears in run logs (easy and immediate).
- (Optional) Use the Prefect UI/CLI to fetch task outputs for the flow run.

Quick code change to log the returned URL (I can apply this for you). Add import and log before returning in `capture_image`:

from prefect import get_run_logger

@flow(...)
def capture_image() -> str:
    logger = get_run_logger()
    cam = A1CamCapture()
    try:
        url = cam._capture_image()
        logger.info(f"Captured image URL: {url}")
        return url
    finally:
        cam.cleanup()

Want me to patch device_prefect.py to add that logger call and re-register the deployment?

User: I didn't see it in the run details /outputs section. Is that right? I should be able to access it

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/bairdst4/Documents/GitHub/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py)

I'll update device_prefect.py to log the returned S3 URL with Prefect's `get_run_logger()` so it appears in the run logs, then re-run the deployment registration script if you want. Applying the code change now.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Patch applied — the flow now logs the captured S3 URL using `get_run_logger().info()`, so the URL will appear in the run logs (and in the Prefect UI Logs view). 

Notes:
- The flow return value still may not appear in the UI Outputs unless you configure result persistence; logging guarantees visibility.
- If you want, I can run the deployment registration (`python src/.../device_prefect.py`) here to update the deployment so new runs use the changed flow. Should I run it now?

Made changes.

User: I already added a print statement in the class itself.

I need results persistence then I guess. #context7 

GitHub Copilot: I'll fetch Prefect documentation on result persistence and storage so you can persist flow outputs.

  "libraryName": "prefect"
}

Completed: *Fix remote worker working directory mismatch* (5/6)

Good — here are concise steps to persist your flow result (S3 example) and how to retrieve it.

1) Create an S3 result block (run once, locally or on Pi):
```python
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket
block = S3Bucket(bucket_name="YOUR_BUCKET", aws_access_key_id="...", aws_secret_access_key="...", region_name="...")
block.save("a1-cam-results", overwrite=True)
```

2) Update `capture_image` decorator in device_prefect.py:
```python
@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="a1-cam-results", result_serializer="json")
def capture_image() -> str:
    ...
```

3) Re-register the deployment (on the machine where workers will run, e.g. the Pi):
```bash
conda activate ac-dev-lab
python src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py
```

4) Run and retrieve results:
- Trigger run via UI or CLI:
  prefet deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'
- Retrieve persisted result programmatically:
  - Use the Prefect UI Outputs, or
  - From Python, get the flow run state and call `.result()`:
```python
state = client.read_flow_run(<flow_run_id>)  # via prefect client
result = state.result()  # or await state.aresult() for async
```
Or if you call the flow locally:
```python
state = capture_image(return_state=True)
print(state.result())  # returns the URI
```

Want me to (A) patch device_prefect.py with the decorator change and re-deploy here, or (B) give the exact commands to create the S3 block using your existing `BUCKET_NAME` and secrets? Which do you prefer?

User: It's just a simple string that I need to be able to get access to afterwards (i.e., by the orchestrator that calls run_deployment(...))

GitHub Copilot: Yes — persist the flow result and then fetch it via the Prefect client. Summary + exact steps you can follow (S3 example):

1) Create an S3 result block (once). Replace placeholders with your secrets:
```python
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket
block = S3Bucket(bucket_name="YOUR_BUCKET",
                 aws_access_key_id="...", aws_secret_access_key="...", region_name="...")
block.save("a1-cam-results", overwrite=True)
```

2) Make the flow persist its result (update device_prefect.py):
```python
from prefect import flow, get_run_logger

@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="a1-cam-results", result_serializer="json")
def capture_image() -> str:
    logger = get_run_logger()
    cam = A1CamCapture()
    try:
        uri = cam._capture_image()
        logger.info(f"Captured image URL: {uri}")
        return uri
    finally:
        cam.cleanup()
```
Re-register the deployment on the machine where the worker runs:
```bash
conda activate ac-dev-lab
python src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/device_prefect.py
```

3) Trigger a deployment run (CLI or UI). Example CLI:
```bash
prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image'
```

4) Programmatically retrieve the persisted return value (async client example):
```python
import asyncio
from prefect.client.orchestration import get_client

async def run_and_get():
    async with get_client() as client:
        # create a flow run from the deployment name
        fr = await client.create_flow_run_from_deployment_name("capture-image/capture-image")
        # wait for completion
        state = await client.wait_for_flow_run(fr.id)
        # retrieve persisted result (raises on failure)
        result = await state.aresult(raise_on_failure=True)
        print("Captured URI:", result)

asyncio.run(run_and_get())
```
Note: `state.aresult()` returns the persisted value if `persist_result=True` and `result_storage` was configured properly.

If you prefer sync code, you can use `run_deployment(...)` or call the client synchronously in your orchestrator — the key is to wait for the flow run state and call `.result()`/`.aresult()`.

Want me to:
- (A) Patch device_prefect.py with the decorator change and re-deploy here, or
- (B) Create/save the S3 block for you using existing secrets and re-deploy, or
- (C) give a ready-to-run orchestrator script using the exact Prefect client calls for your environment?

Pick one and I’ll take it.

User: That seems so.. convoluted, to use an S3 block to pass the string result of a function from one device to another

GitHub Copilot: You're right — S3 is overkill for a single string. Simpler options:

- Preferred (no external storage): have your orchestrator create the flow run via the Prefect client, wait for completion, then fetch the flow run state and call `.result()` / `.aresult()` to get the returned string. This requires no S3; only that the orchestrator can talk to the Prefect API and wait for the run to finish. If you need durability across restarts, enable persistence; otherwise immediate retrieval works fine.

Async example (copy into your orchestrator):
```python
import asyncio
from prefect.client.orchestration import get_client

async def run_and_get():
    async with get_client() as client:
        fr = await client.create_flow_run_from_deployment_name("capture-image/capture-image")
        state = await client.wait_for_flow_run(fr.id)          # wait until finished
        result = await state.aresult(raise_on_failure=True)    # get the returned string
        return result

print(asyncio.run(run_and_get()))
```

Notes:
- If you need sync code, run the above via `asyncio.run(...)` or adapt using Prefect's sync helpers.
- If the flow result is ephemeral and you must retrieve it later (after the run finishes and orchestrator restarted), set `@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage=...)` and choose a storage the orchestrator can read (S3, shared filesystem, etc.). For immediate retrieval right after run completion, persistence is not required.

Want me to add a small `orchestrator.py` script using the async snippet and test it against your deployment?

User: yes

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a small async orchestrator script `scripts/run_capture_orchestrator.py` that triggers the deployment, waits for completion, and prints the returned string. Then I'll mark the todo as completed.

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/bairdst4/Documents/GitHub/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/scripts/run_capture_orchestrator.py)

Completed: *Enable result persistence / orchestrator* (6/6)

Done — added run_capture_orchestrator.py. Run it like:

```bash
python scripts/run_capture_orchestrator.py               # uses capture-image/capture-image

```

It creates a flow run, waits for completion, and prints the returned string. Want me to run it now against your deployment?

User: sure

GitHub Copilot: I'll activate the `ac-dev-lab` env and run the orchestrator script to create a flow run and print its result.

Ran terminal command: (C:\Users\bairdst4\AppData\Local\miniforge3\shell\condabin\conda-hook.ps1) ; conda activate ac-dev-lab ; python scripts/run_capture_orchestrator.py

The orchestrator ran but the Prefect client call failed: `PrefectClient` has no method `create_flow_run_from_deployment_name`. Use `create_flow_run_from_deployment` instead. Should I patch run_capture_orchestrator.py to call `create_flow_run_from_deployment` (and then re-run)?

User: y

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the orchestrator to call the correct Prefect client method (`create_flow_run_from_deployment`) and then run the script to verify.

User: why not just use run_deployment(...)?

GitHub Copilot: Yes — `run_deployment(...)` is the simplest, correct choice for an orchestrator that just needs to trigger a deployment and get its return value.

Why use it
- Convenience: creates the flow run, waits for completion, and returns the resulting State.
- Simpler than manually creating the flow run with the client and polling/waiting.
- Use `state.result()` / `state.aresult()` to fetch the flow return value (or raise on failure).

Example (sync):
```python
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment

# returns a State object
state = run_deployment("capture-image/capture-image")

# raise if the flow failed, otherwise get the returned string
result = state.result(raise_on_failure=True)
print("Captured URI:", result)
```

If you prefer async or need more control (inspect IDs, run multiple runs concurrently, custom polling), use the `get_client()` approach we added earlier.

Want me to update run_capture_orchestrator.py to use `run_deployment(...)` instead and re-run it?

User: y

User: Just look up the official docs #context7 

GitHub Copilot: Ran `get-library-docs` 
Completed with input: {
  "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/prefecthq/prefect",
  "topic": "run_deployment",
  "tokens": 2000
}

I pulled the official Prefect docs for `run_deployment`. Short summary + minimal examples.

Key points
- `run_deployment(...)` is the simplest way to trigger a deployment from Python. It can be used sync or async and supports parameters, timeout, tags, scheduling, job variables, etc.
- The function returns a FlowRun object (or coroutine/FlowRun when awaited). It does not itself return the flow's final value.
- To get the flow return value you must fetch the FlowRun's State and call `aresult()` / `result()` on the State (or use the Prefect client helpers to wait and fetch).
- CLI equivalents: `prefect deployment run <name>` and `--watch` to follow output.

Minimal async pattern (docs):
```py
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment
from prefect.client.orchestration import get_client

# trigger (async)
flow_run = await run_deployment(name="capture-image/capture-image", timeout=300)

# fetch state & persisted/in-memory result
async with get_client() as client:
    flow_run_obj = await client.read_flow_run(flow_run.id)
    state = flow_run_obj.state
    result = await state.aresult(raise_on_failure=True)
```

Minimal sync pattern (docs / convenience):
```py
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment

flow_run = run_deployment(name="capture-image/capture-image", timeout=300)
# then query the API (async client) or use client helpers to read the state/result
```

CLI quick option:
- `prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image' --watch` (prints run logs; use UI or API to retrieve final value)

If you want, I can:
- Update run_capture_orchestrator.py to use the async pattern above and return the string, or
- Provide a tiny sync wrapper that uses `run_deployment(..., timeout=...)` then an async client call to fetch `state.aresult()` — whichever you prefer.

User: Whatever's simpler / more self-contained / easier to read

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the orchestrator to use an async `run_deployment` + Prefect client read of the flow run, then run it to fetch the returned string.

Ran terminal command: (C:\Users\bairdst4\AppData\Local\miniforge3\shell\condabin\conda-hook.ps1) ; conda activate ac-dev-lab ; python scripts/run_capture_orchestrator.py

The error means the flow run completed on a remote worker but its return value wasn't persisted, so the API can't load it later (State.aresult raised MissingResult).

Options (short):
- Best if orchestrator and worker are different hosts — persist results. Add persistence to the flow and a reachable storage (S3 or a shared filesystem) so `state.aresult()` works.
  - Example change to device_prefect.py:
    @flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="a1-cam-results", result_serializer="json")
  - Create an S3 block (once) and reuse your BUCKET_NAME / secrets.
- If orchestrator runs on the same host/process as the worker (not your case here), you could run the flow locally or use an in-process run so the return value is available without persistence.
- CLI alternative: run `prefect deployment run 'capture-image/capture-image' --watch` and parse logs, but that's fragile.

Which do you want me to do next?
- A: Patch device_prefect.py to persist results to S3 using your `BUCKET_NAME` and re-deploy (I can create the S3 block and deploy).
- B: Persist to a local path (only if orchestrator can access the same filesystem as the worker).
- C: I can add a small helper that prints the result into the flow logs (already added) and have the orchestrator scrape logs (less reliable).

Pick A, B, or C and I’ll apply the changes and re-register the deployment.

User: At this point, wouldn't I just use Prefect's S3 integration instead of boto3 to begin with? Likewise, it really seems like I shouldn't need to use S3 or log scraping to get a device on one network to receive a string from a device on another network #context7 

GitHub Copilot: Summarized conversation historyI'll add a short todo, then fetch Prefect docs on S3 blocks and result persistence to recommend the simplest approach.

Completed: *Fetch Prefect S3 docs* (1/1)

Short answer: yes — prefer Prefect's S3 integration/blocks + result persistence over hand-rolling boto3 and log-scraping; and no, you don't need to scrape logs to get a string across networks if you use result persistence or an external, shared store.

Why and recommended approaches (concise):
- Prefect S3 blocks:
  - Integrates with Prefect's result storage API, UI, and blocks system (create an `S3Bucket` block with `AwsCredentials`, save it, and reference it as `result_storage`).
  - Example: create an S3 block, then decorate the flow:
    - `@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="s3/my-result-storage", result_serializer="json")`
  - Benefits vs boto3: central credential management (blocks), standardized serialization, automatic persistence and retrieval via `state.result()` / `aresult()`, and easier deployment config (storage + work pools).
- Alternatives to S3 (if S3 isn't desirable):
  - Shared filesystem accessible to both hosts (use `PREFECT_LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` or local result storage).
  - Use a lightweight external service both networks can reach: Redis, MQTT broker, or an HTTP webhook (Flask/FastAPI) that the device can POST to and the orchestrator can poll.
  - Use Prefect Blocks for other storage (GitHub, Azure Blob, etc.) — same integration benefits.
- When you still might use boto3:
  - If you need advanced/custom S3 behavior not supported by the block, or you already have a custom S3 abstraction. But you can still load `AwsCredentials` from a Prefect block and create a boto3 client — Prefect docs show that pattern.
- Practical recommendation for your setup:
  - If orchestrator and Pi are on different networks, enable persistence and use S3 (or another shared storage) — simplest, robust, and supported by Prefect:
    1. Create an `S3Bucket` block with your bucket and `AwsCredentials`.
    2. Update `capture_image` to persist (flow-level or task-level): `@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="s3/your-block-name", result_serializer="json")`
    3. Redeploy (preferably registering deployment from the same environment or set storage so workers can pull code).
    4. Orchestrator can `run_deployment(...)`, then read the flow run state and call `state.aresult(raise_on_failure=True)` to get the string — this works because the result is persisted to S3 and rehydrated by the API.
  - If you prefer not to manage S3, set up a small HTTP endpoint the orchestrator can poll or that the device can POST to when capture completes.
If you want, I can:
- Patch device_prefect.py to use `@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="s3/<block-name>", result_serializer="json")` and add a short `scripts/create_s3_block.py` that creates the `S3Bucket` & `AwsCredentials` blocks from your existing `my_secrets` values, then re-deploy instructions. Would you like me to implement that?

Done — I patched run_capture_orchestrator_context7.py so it no longer crashes when you pass a deployment slug (like `capture-image/capture-image`) instead of a UUID.

What I changed
- Accepts either a UUID or a deployment name/slug.
- If the identifier parses as a UUID it uses `client.create_flow_run_from_deployment(deployment_id=UUID(...))`.
- Otherwise it calls Prefect's `run_deployment(...)` (run inside `asyncio.to_thread`) to accept deployment slugs.
- Handles sync/async `state.result()` variants when returning the flow result.

Why this fixes your error
- The ValueError came from calling `UUID(deployment_id)` on a slug; now we try parsing and only call `UUID(...)` when valid, avoiding the exception.

How to run
- Use either a UUID or the deployment slug:
  - UUID example:
    ```bash
    python src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/_scripts/prefect/run_capture_orchestrator_context7.py
    ```
    (edit the `deployment_identifier` in the script or refactor to accept a CLI arg)
  - Slug example (default in the script now):
    ```bash
    # script uses "capture-image/capture-image" by default
    python src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/_scripts/prefect/run_capture_orchestrator_context7.py
    ```

Next recommendations
- If you need the orchestrator to reliably read the returned URI after the run (across hosts), enable result persistence (S3 or other shared storage) as discussed earlier; otherwise `state.result()` may fail with MissingResult. I can:
  - Patch device_prefect.py to add `@flow(persist_result=True, result_storage="s3/<block-name>", result_serializer="json")` and add a script to create the `S3Bucket` block from your `my_secrets`, or
  - Update the orchestrator to accept a CLI arg for deployment identifier.

Which of those would you like next?
