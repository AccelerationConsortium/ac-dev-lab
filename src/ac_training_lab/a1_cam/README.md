# A1 Mini Overhead Toolhead Camera

This is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with a Raspberry Pi Camera
Module 3.

## Codebase

Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi Zero 2W device via HTTPS (allows for `git pull` to work without needing to enter credentials each time):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab.git
```

Navigate to the same directory as this README file:

```bash
cd /home/ac/ac-training-lab/src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam/
```

## Secrets

Make a copy of `my_secrets_example.py` called `my_secrets.py` and
fill in the necessary information. Keep in mind this will store the credentials in plain-text format.

## Dependencies

If not already installed (not pre-installed on RPi OS Lite), install [`picamera2`](https://github.com/<REDACTED>pi/picamera2) via:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 --no-install-recommends
```

`libcamera` should be automatically installed after installing `picamera2`. Otherwise, one would use `sudo apt install -y python3-libcamera` (`libcamera` also does not come preinstalled on RPi OS Lite versions).

Use the `venv` command to create a virtual environment to a new folder `venv` with the `--system-site-packages` flag so that it can use the `picamera2` and `libcamera` libraries and activate the environment via the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

While one could use the built-in Python installation (this device is intended to be run via a single top-level script, the RPi device (in our case RPi Zero 2W) requires minimal setup (i.e., can easily be reflashed), and the RPi device is intended for a single purpose with a single set of requirements (i.e., a "point-and-shoot" camera)), the extra steps involved to make this work are as equally onerous as using a venv [[context](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-training-lab/pull/178#issuecomment-2730490626)], hence we only include instructions assuming a venv.

Next, install the requirements via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## "Local" (i.e., not RPi OS) OS Development

For local development (e.g., on your PC rather than the Raspberry Pi to make version control easier) with a dummy version of `picamera2` (very minimal mock package), while in the same folder as this README file, additionally run:

```bash
pip install -e ./dummy_pkg/ # WARNING: do not install this on the Raspberry Pi for the toolhead camera -- the imports will overlap with the "real" system packages `picamera2` and `libcamera`.
```

## Running the Device

To start the device manually and ensure that it's functioning normally, run:

```bash
python3 device.py
```

## Automatic startup

To create the file, run nano (or other editor of choice):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/a1-cam.service
```

Copy the following code into the file (right click to paste), save it via `Ctrl+O` and `Enter` and exit via `Ctrl+X`:

```yaml
[Unit]
Description=Start a1-cam device.py script
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
# Launch the device script (adjust the path as needed)
WorkingDirectory=/home/ac/ac-training-lab/src/ac_training_lab/a1_cam
ExecStart=venv/bin/python3 device.py
# Restart on unexpected failure – if the script exits with an error, systemd will restart it
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

# Limit restart attempts to avoid a rapid infinite loop:
StartLimitIntervalSec=12h # (i.e., up to max 9 times per day, assuming a StartLimitBurst of 3)
StartLimitBurst=3

# Allow up to 60 seconds for the script to start properly
TimeoutStartSec=60

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Run:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable a1-cam.service
sudo systemctl start a1-cam.service
```

Run:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following at the end of the crontab file:

```bash
#
# Restart at 2 am, local time (set up during flashing, or specified manually via e.g., `sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York`)
0 2 * * * /sbin/shutdown -r now
```

You can manually start the service by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ac-device.service
```

This command tells systemd to run your service immediately (as if it had been triggered at boot). To check its status, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl status a1-cam.service
```

To view any logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u a1-cam.service -f
```

Starting the service with `systemd` is recommended since it applies all the configured options (dependencies, restart behavior, etc.).

For more details, see the [systemctl(1)](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html) manual.


To stop the service (for example, while you work on fixing it), run:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop a1-cam.service
```

This command stops the running instance of the service immediately. If you also want to prevent it from starting at boot until you've fixed it, you can disable it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable a1-cam.service
```

You can list all available service unit files by running:

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
```

This will display a list of service files along with their state (enabled, disabled, static, etc.). It shows unit files from all directories (such as `/etc/systemd/system`, `/usr/lib/systemd/system`, and `/run/systemd/system`).

For a list of all loaded (active or inactive) service units, you can use:

```bash
systemctl list-units --all --type=service
```

<!-- While a virtual environment on RPi OS Lite will give you pip, this does not come preinstalled on the built-in Python on RPi OS Lite. To install pip, run:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
```
> NOTE: The `-y` flag is used to automatically answer "yes" to any installation prompts. -->
