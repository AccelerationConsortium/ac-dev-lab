# OpenFlexure Delta Stage Microscope - Objective Lens Bill of Materials

This document provides recommendations for objective lenses compatible with the OpenFlexure Delta Stage Microscope, specifically for 160mm tube length (finite optics, not infinity corrected).

## Issue Context

The original issue highlighted the need for appropriate 160mm tube length objectives instead of infinity-corrected ones. Specific requirements:
- **Tube Length**: 160mm (finite corrected)
- **Magnification**: 40x or greater (e.g., 50x, 60x), or 20x alternative
- **Working Distance**: Approximately 3mm or greater
- **Threading**: RMS (Royal Microscopical Society) standard

### Option 4: Olympus SLMPLN 20X (Super Long WD, Premium Option)
- **Manufacturer**: Olympus
- **Model**: SLMPLN 20X
- **Magnification**: 20x
- **Numerical Aperture (NA)**: 0.25 (lower than LMPLFLN due to longer WD)
- **Working Distance (WD)**: 25mm ✓✓ (exceptional working distance)
- **Tube Length**: 160mm
- **Threading**: RMS standard
- **Optical Correction**: Super long working distance plan
- **Applications**: Electronic assembly inspection, semiconductor inspection, specimens requiring extreme clearance

**Notes**:
- Extremely long working distance (25mm) ideal for thick specimens or unusual geometries
- Lower NA (0.25) means lower resolution compared to LMPLFLN 20X
- Premium pricing
- Best for applications requiring maximum clearance

### Option 5: Olympus SLMPLN 50X (Super Long WD, High Mag Premium)
- **Manufacturer**: Olympus
- **Model**: SLMPLN 50X

- Working distances are insufficient for the 3mm requirement
- May be suitable if working with standard thin coverslips (0.17mm) and no special clearance needs
- Good color correction but not apochromatic or semi-apochromat quality

## Recommendation Summary

**Primary Recommendation**: **Olympus LMPLFLN 20X** or **LMPLFLN 50X**
- Both meet the 3mm working distance requirement
- 160mm finite tube length (not infinity corrected)
- RMS threading for compatibility
- Reasonable pricing for the quality ($350-600)
- Semi-apochromat optical quality
- Available from reputable suppliers

**Choice Between 20X and 50X**:
- **Choose 20X if**: You need the best working distance (12mm), want a lower cost option, need a larger field of view, or are working with thicker specimens
- **Choose 50X if**: You need higher magnification/resolution (meets "40x or greater" requirement better), still need good working distance (10.6mm), and budget allows

**For Specialized Applications**: If extreme working distance is needed and budget allows, the **Olympus SLMPLN** series offers 18-25mm working distances but at significantly higher cost.
