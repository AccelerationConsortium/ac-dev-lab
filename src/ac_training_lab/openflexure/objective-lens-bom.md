# OpenFlexure Delta Stage Microscope - Objective Lens Bill of Materials

This document provides recommendations for objective lenses compatible with the OpenFlexure Delta Stage Microscope, specifically for 160mm tube length (finite optics, not infinity corrected).

## Issue Context

The original issue highlighted the need for appropriate 160mm tube length objectives instead of infinity-corrected ones. Specific requirements:
- **Tube Length**: 160mm (finite corrected)
- **Magnification**: 40x or greater (e.g., 50x, 60x), or 20x alternative
- **Working Distance**: Approximately 3mm or greater
- **Threading**: RMS (Royal Microscopical Society) standard

## Recommendation Summary

**Primary Recommendation**: **Olympus LMPLFLN 20X** or **LMPLFLN 50X**
- Both meet the 3mm working distance requirement
- 160mm finite tube length (not infinity corrected)
- RMS threading for compatibility
- Reasonable pricing for the quality ($350-600 new, ~$235-760 used on eBay)
- Semi-apochromat optical quality
- Available from reputable suppliers and secondary markets

**Best Value Option**: **Used LMPLFLN 50X from eBay** (~$538-759)
- Meets all requirements (50x magnification, 10.6mm WD, 160mm tube length)
- 40-70% cost savings compared to new
- Often includes free shipping from Japanese sellers
- Higher magnification than 20x option

**Choice Between 20X and 50X**:
- **Choose 20X if**: You need the best working distance (12mm), want a lower cost option, need a larger field of view, or are working with thicker specimens
- **Choose 50X if**: You need higher magnification/resolution (meets "40x or greater" requirement better), still need good working distance (10.6mm), and budget allows

**For Specialized Applications**: If extreme working distance is needed and budget allows, the **Olympus SLMPLN** series offers 18-25mm working distances but at significantly higher cost.
