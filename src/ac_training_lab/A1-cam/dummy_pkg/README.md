Just a dummy package for making it easier to test the rest of the code on a
non-RPi OS (e.g., Windows).


To install, navigate to the directory containing the `dummy_pkg` directory and
run the following commands (or just the appropriate paths as you like):
```
cd dummy_pkg
pip install -e .
cd ..
```
